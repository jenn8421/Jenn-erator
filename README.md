# Jenn-erator Password Generator🔐

A Python-based password generator that creates strong, secure passwords following NIST guidelines.

## Description

Jenn-erator is a command-line password generator tool that creates customizable passwords with varying character types. The application not only generates passwords but also evaluates their strength based on the latest NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) guidelines, which emphasize password length over complexity.

## Features 💡

- Generate passwords with customizable numbers of letters, symbols, and numbers
- Randomize character placement for enhanced security
- Evaluate password strength based primarily on length (aligned with NIST SP 800-63B guidelines)
- Provide informational feedback on character variety
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## NIST Compliance ☑️

This password generator follows current NIST password guidelines by:
- Emphasizing password length (minimum 8 characters, recommending 12+ characters)
- Providing informational feedback about character variety without strict requirements
- Encouraging the use of password managers
- Focusing on usable security principles


## Usage 💻

1. Run the script
2. Follow the prompts
3. Receive your generated password along with strength evaluation and recommendations

## Example
